// This example builds upon the HelloSine example to implement some very basic FM synthesis,
// and builds in some simple pattern sequencing to create an interesting arp.
//
// We start here with a couple simple constants: these map a few common note names
// to their respective frequencies, from which we'll construct a simple arpeggio pattern.
const e4 = 329.63 * 0.5;
const b4 = 493.88 * 0.5;
const e5 = 659.26 * 0.5;
const g5 = 783.99 * 0.5;

// Here we put together the patterns: each just a simple array of the notes above. We
// have two patterns here each with a slightly different note order, and the latter of
// which is slightly detuned from the original frequencies.

// Now, an FM Synthesis voice where the carrier is a sine wave at the given
// frequency, `fq`, and the modulator is another sine wave at the 3.17 times the given frequency.
//
// The FM amount ratio oscillates between [1, 3] at 0.1Hz.

// This example is a quick exercise in unison for a polyblep sawtooth synth voice.
//
// To start, we construct a synth voice function here which takes a frequency value, `freq`,
// at which to run the oscillators, and a `delta` value which can be thought of as a "spread"
// parameter for voice unison. We then construct and return an array of 7 sawtooth voices running
// in parallel, each randomly distributed between [freq, freq + delta].

// Here, because more is just better (right?), we extend the above voice into
// a bigger "superVoice," which adds four "voice" instances together, yielding
// a single sawtooth voice with 28 unison voices all playing around the given
// frequency.
